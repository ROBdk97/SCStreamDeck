## Current Features

- **Adaptive Key**: A key that executes keybindings based on the activation mode for a given binding.
    - *Example:* Two in-game bindings (Tap vs Hold) on `Num-` executes only the Tap function when this is the assigned function.
- **Adaptive Dial** *(Stream Deck+)*: A dial that maps separate Star Citizen functions to rotate left, rotate right, and dial push. Rotation fires the assigned function once per tick; push respects the action's activation mode.
- **Toggle Key**: A key that toggles between two states (e.g., landing gear up/down). Can be reset to match the current in-game state on de-sync.
- **Control Panel Key**: A dedicated key for managing global plugin settings such as themes, preferred channel selection, per-channel installation overrides, and plugin language.
- **Auto-Detection of Star Citizen Installation Path**: Automatically detects the installation path of Star Citizen.
- **Multiple Channels Support**: Supports LIVE, HOTFIX, PTU, EPTU, and TECH-PREVIEW installations.
- **Plugin UI Localization**: Built-in plugin and Property Inspector localization for English, German, French, and Spanish, with auto-detect and a Control Panel override.
- **Mouse Wheel Support**: Supports mouse wheel actions for bindings that use mouse wheel input (Mouse Wheel Up/Down).
- **Custom Language Support**: Supports custom language files for localization when using custom global.ini from the community, e.g. [StarCitizen-Deutsch-INI by rjcncpt](https://github.com/rjcncpt/StarCitizen-Deutsch-INI).
- **Theme Support**: Themes for customizing the appearance of the plugin. Includes a template for creating your own themes!
- **Click Sound**: Provides audio feedback on key presses with configurable sound files (.wav and .mp3).


## Installation

See the full installation guide: https://robdk97.github.io/SCStreamDeck/install/

## Known Limitations

**Mouse buttons (mouse1 - mouse5) don't work while moving the mouse in Star Citizen**  

Star Citizen can ignore synthetic mouse button events sent by Windows user-mode injection (the plugin uses `SendInput`) while the game is actively reading mouse movement for aiming/flying (relative mouse input).   
This can make Stream Deck-triggered mouse clicks (mouse1–mouse5, including MMB/mouse3) unreliable unless the mouse is perfectly still.

Workarounds:

- Prefer binding Stream Deck actions to **keyboard keys** in Star Citizen.

Why not “fix” it in the plugin?

- The "reliable" approach is HID-level injection (virtual mouse / driver). This plugin intentionally avoids driver-based input injection due to potential anti-cheat / ToS risk.

## Credits

Star Citizen Stream Deck Plugin uses the following open-source projects and libraries:

- [streamdeck-tools by BarRaider](https://github.com/BarRaider/streamdeck-tools) - for the excellent C# library.
- [sdpi-components by GeekyEggo](https://github.com/GeekyEggo/sdpi-components) - for the excellent Stream Deck Property Inspector components.
- [InputSimulatorPlus by TChatzigiannakis](https://github.com/TChatzigiannakis/InputSimulatorPlus) - (although i think this might be a modified fork of BarRaider, will verify later)
- [NAudio by Mark Heath](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio) - for audio playback support.

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by the following repositories (code rewritten from scratch and optimized):

- [unp4k by dolkensp](https://github.com/dolkensp/unp4k) - for letting me browse through the P4K file and understand its structure.
- [SCJMapper-V2 by SCToolsfactory](https://github.com/SCToolsfactory/SCJMapper-V2) - for the great work on Star Citizen keybindings extraction.
- [streamdeck-starcitizen by mhwlng](https://github.com/mhwlng/streamdeck-starcitizen) - for the initial idea of a Stream Deck plugin for Star Citizen. :)
- [SCStreamDeck by Jarex985](https://github.com/Jarex985/SCStreamDeck) - Forked because the owner was inactive
