# Troubleshooting

## Plugin is stuck on "Loading functions..."

1. If you installed the **advanced** package, make sure .NET 10 Desktop Runtime x64 is installed. [Requirements](install.md#requirements)
2. Close Stream Deck completely then open it again.
3. If the issue persists, go to `%APPDATA%\Elgato\StreamDeck\Plugins\com.robdk97.scstreamdeck.sdPlugin\`.
4. Open the plugin log file (`pluginlog.log`) and check for errors.
5. If you installed the **advanced** package and there is no log file, this usually indicates that .NET 10 Desktop Runtime x64 is not installed correctly (x86 vs x64 issue). Reinstall the correct version.

## The plugin does not show up in Stream Deck

1. Confirm the Stream Deck app is version 6.4+.
2. If you installed the **advanced** package, confirm .NET 10 Desktop Runtime is installed. [Requirements](install.md#requirements)
3. Close Stream Deck completely then open it again.
4. Go to `%APPDATA%\Elgato\StreamDeck\Plugins`. If you see a folder named `com.robdk97.scstreamdeck.sdPlugin`, delete it and try reinstalling after confirming steps 1 and 2.

## Double-clicking the downloaded `.streamDeckPlugin` file does nothing

1. Right-click the downloaded file and choose `Properties`.
2. If you see an `Unblock` checkbox, enable it.
3. Click `OK` and try again.
4. Make sure that you uninstalled any previous versions of the plugin.

!!! note
    Windows SmartScreen or antivirus can block new downloads. If the file was removed, download it again.

## Star Citizen path not detected

1. Drag `Control Panel` from the right panel and drop it to a desired key on the left.
2. Set a custom installation path for your desired channel (`LIVE`, `HOTFIX`, `PTU`, `EPTU`).

## Actions do nothing in game

- Make sure Star Citizen is the active window.
- Try running the Stream Deck app as Administrator.
- If you changed any keybinding in-game while using the Plugin, you can either:

    1. Restart Stream Deck app.
    2. Use `Control Panel` and click `FORCE REDETECTION`.  
  

- Mouse button binds don't work while moving (mouse1 - mouse5)
If an in-game action is bound to `mouse1`…`mouse5`, Stream Deck-triggered input may only register when the mouse is not moving. 
This is a Star Citizen (EAC) limitation with synthetic mouse events (`SendInput`) during relative mouse handling.
Use a keyboard bind for Stream Deck actions for best reliability.

## I can't see Adaptive Key / Toggle Key in the Multi Action list

This has been disabled by default, if you want to enable it:

1. Go to `%APPDATA%\Elgato\StreamDeck\Plugins\com.robdk97.scstreamdeck.sdPlugin\`.
2. Open `manifest.json` in a text editor.
3. Find the line with `"SupportedInMultiActions": false,` and change it to `"SupportedInMultiActions": true,`.

!!! note
    I would recommend not using Toggle Keys in Multi Actions, as their state management can lead to unexpected behavior. Adaptive Keys are generally safe to use in Multi Actions.
