## v1.2.0.0 - Minor Release

### Features / Improvements

- Added `Adaptive Dial` action for Stream Deck+ devices. Supports assigning separate Star Citizen functions to rotate left, rotate right, and dial push. Rotation executes the assigned function once per tick. Push respects the action's activation mode (e.g., Tap vs Hold).
- Click sound support for the `Adaptive Dial` (same `.wav`/`.mp3` configuration as `Adaptive Key`).
- Added dual release packages for installation:
  - `runtime-included` for the simple install path with the .NET runtime bundled
  - `runtime-required` for the smaller advanced install path that uses the system-installed .NET 10 Desktop Runtime x64
- Updated the plugin/runtime target to `.NET 10`.
- Added plugin UI localization for English, German, French, and Spanish.
- Added a `Plugin Language` setting in the `Control Panel` with auto-detect and manual override support.
- Added `TECH-PREVIEW` as a supported Star Citizen channel alongside `LIVE`, `HOTFIX`, `PTU`, and `EPTU`.

### Internal / Refactor

- `SCActionBase` and `ControlPanelKey` now inherit from `KeypadBase` instead of `KeyAndEncoderBase`, removing stub dial/touchpad overrides that were never used for key actions.
- Added explicit `Controllers` declarations (`Keypad` / `Encoder`) to all actions in `manifest.json`.
- Added unit tests for `AdaptiveDial` covering rotation resolution and executable binding resolution.
- Refactored Property Inspector function picker logic into shared helpers (`SCPI.functionPicker`) used by both key and dial scripts, reducing duplicated code.

### Documentation

- Updated the docs for the two install methods (`Simple` and `Advanced`) and the new release package names.
- Documented `Control Panel` language selection, plugin localization support, and `TECH-PREVIEW` channel support.

## v1.1.3.0 - Patch Release

### Features / Improvements

- Bindings that use mwheel_up/mwheel_down will be retriggered while key is held down.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an Issue where some modifier keys didn't properly execute when combined with a mouse button.
- Fixed an Issue where `Hold` ActivationModes triggered multiple times when a binding had a modifier key

## v1.1.2.0 - Minor Release

### Features / Improvements

- Added `ActionMapsWatcherService` to monitor changes in `actionmaps.xml` and auto-sync keybindings in Stream Deck profiles when changes are detected (e.g., after in-game rebinding).
- Toggle Key now only shows Actions that are considered to be a `Toggle` based on their metadata, improving usability and reducing confusion.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where actions with the same name/binding but different category/map would not be parsed correctly, which could lead to one action incorrectly shown as `Unbound`.
- Fixed an issue where Toggle Key would not maintain its state when switching between different pages on the Stream Deck, leading to inconsistent behavior. Now only resets the state when the user explicitly triggers the reset, or the application restarts.
- Fixed an issue where some action bindings would not get parsed and show up as `Unbound` (e.g., `focus_on_chat_textinput` with `return` key).

### Documentation

- Added a note about mouse button bindings not working when moving the mouse. This is a Star Citizen (EAC) limitation which i can't do anything about.

### Internal / Refactor

- Introduced a keybindings JSON schema version to force-refresh cached keybindings when the data format changes.

## v1.0.2.0 - Patch Release
> [!NOTE]
> This update introduces a stable v2 identifier format for saved function bindings (v2|<actionName>|<mapName>).
> Existing Stream Deck profiles using the legacy format remain supported and will auto-migrate when the key becomes active/visible.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where some keybindings would not get parsed correctly if it just contained a modifier (e.g. `Left Ctrl`), 
  or didn't have a UICategory assigned. 

## v1.0.1.0 - Patch Release

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where Data.p4k was not closed properly after reading, which could lead to file locks (e.g. when verifying game files in the launcher).

## v1.0.0.0 - Major Release
> [!NOTE]
> No breaking changes from v0.3.0.0. This is the first stable, feature-complete release for the planned scope.

### Features / Improvements

- Added `Toggle Key` to switch between two states, with an optional reset if the state gets out of sync
- Removed unbound functions category from the function dropdown
- Added a warning indicator for functions that have no keybinding
- Improved `Force Redetection` to re-scan `actionmaps.xml` from auto-detected installs and custom install paths, then refresh cached data

### Bug Fixes

- Various minor bug fixes and improvements

### Documentation

- Updated documentation to reflect new features and changes
- Added a legal note and “Made by the Community” badge to the docs site
- Minor spelling/grammar fixes across the docs

### Internal / Refactor

## v0.3.0.0 - Minor Release

### Features / Improvements

- Added a new `Control Panel` key along with a redesigned Property Inspector UI/UX
- Added theme switching support and a shared base CSS stylesheet so users can create custom themes
- Added the `Default` and `Crusader Blue` themes
- Added channel switching support to the `Control Panel` key
- Improved `Control Panel` UI/UX for channel overrides and state management (clearer loading/success/error states)
- Improved keybinding processing and action mapping (better label disambiguation and metadata usage)
- Improved installation detection UX/messaging
- Removed the `custom-paths.ini` workaround (custom paths are now managed via the `Control Panel` key)

### Bug Fixes

- None explicitly called out for this release (mostly new functionality plus stability/UX improvements)

### Internal / Refactor

- Major refactor/cleanup across keybinding services (executor/parser wiring simplifications; removed unused deps; some helpers moved to static)
- Reduced risk hotspots and improved maintainability by extracting logic into focused helpers/services
- Expanded and reorganized unit tests significantly (keybinding parsing/execution, activation modes, installation/state, localization, data parsing)
- Reduced reliance on `[ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]` by covering previously excluded logic with tests
- SonarQube/Rider-driven cleanup: reduced cognitive complexity, standardized formatting, removed dead code, tightened access modifiers
- DI/service initialization cleanup and consolidation

## v0.2.2.1

### Features / Improvements

- (Experimental) Added a click sound feature to provide audio feedback
- Sound file can be configured for every key in the Property Inspector

### Bug Fixes

- None

### Internal / Refactor

- Major internal refactor of the test project structure and organization
- Removed `UnitTests` and added a `Tests` project with better structure
- Major refactor of the PluginCore project structure and organization
  (should not affect functionality; improves maintainability and readability)


## v0.2.1.0

### Features / Improvements

- Added `custom-paths.ini` as a backup plan if auto-detection still fails to locate the Star Citizen installation path
- Users can manually add installation paths to `custom-paths.ini` located in the plugin root folder
- The plugin checks these paths if auto-detection does not find a valid installation
